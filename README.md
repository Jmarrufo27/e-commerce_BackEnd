## Description
This project is a back end for an eCommerce website that handles all the CREATE, GET, UPDATE, and DELETE routes using express. The models and the api routes were created while the seeds, server, and connection files were starter code.

-----------------------------------------

## Installation Instructions
In order to run the app you must clone the repository to your machine from my github account and add your own .env file with your MySql user, password, and database name and run the seeds using npm run seed, and finally starting the application by running npm start in your terminal.

-----------------------------------------

## Usage
The point of this app is to be able to CREATE, UPDATE, GET, and DELETE products and product information from a make believe eCommerce website all on the back end using some sort of app that is used for designing and interacting with HTTP-based API's like 'Insomnia' or 'Postman' in order to get a better understanding of api routes and how to use them.
